## About The Project

MedRecChain is a decentralized solution for Electronic Medical Records sharing systems (EMR). It utilizes the Ethereum network and IPFS technology to provide a secure and transparent platform for managing and sharing medical records.

Why Choose MedRecChain:

- The entire system of MedRecChain is based on blockchain technology. Hence it is practically un hackable
- There is no actual person behind the organization. It is a smart contract, making it transparent to the public
- All the media is stored on InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) network. Making it completely safe and private.

## Dependencies

To run MedRecChain, you need the following dependencies:

- Ethereum client or provider (e.g., Ganache, Infura)
- IPFS node or gateway
- React development environment

### Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) >= 10.16 and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) >= 5.6 installed.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed in the system.
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle), which can be installed globally with `npm install -g truffle`
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io) extension added to the browser.
- [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/) development network.

### Built With

- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)
- [Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## The Problem

Traditional Electronic Medical Records systems face various challenges, including lack of interoperability, centralized storage, data security and privacy concerns, and limited patient access to their own medical records. These issues hinder efficient and secure sharing of medical information among healthcare providers.

## The Solution

MedRecChain addresses these challenges by leveraging the power of blockchain and IPFS. It provides a decentralized and secure platform where medical records can be stored, accessed, and shared by authorized parties. The use of blockchain ensures data integrity, transparency, and immutability, while IPFS enables efficient and distributed storage of large medical files.

## How Does It Work

- A healthcare provider can register using a crypto wallet like Metamask.
- The healthcare provider can register a patient by using the public address of the patientâ€™s wallet, usually provided during an appointment.
- The health provider can search for a patients, and upload a new record for the patient.
- The patient can also view his or her records, after connected with a wallet which address is registered by the health provider.

## How To Use

Follow the steps below to get started with MedRecChain:

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MedRecChain/MedRecChain.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`

### To deploy the Smart Contract

1. Configure the Ethereum network or provider in the `truffle-config.js` file.
2. Compile the smart contracts: `truffle compile`
3. Deploy the smart contracts: `truffle migrate`

### To run the React development server

1. Start the development server: `npm start`

## To Run IPFS locally

## Install

```js
npm i --location=global ipfs
```

## Run server

```js
jsipfs daemon
```

> to visit it click `http://127.0.0.1:5002/webui`

## !! to avoid the forbidden Error that happens when you upload images

## `open PowerShell then write this`

```git
- jsipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '[\"http://127.0.0.1:5002\", \"http://localhost:3000\", \"http://127.0.0.1:5001\", \"https://webui.ipfs.io\"]'

- jsipfs config --json API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Methods '[\"PUT\", \"POST\"]'
```

> also Don't forget to open Server
> `jsipfs daemon`
